## Overview

### Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs)
EOFs are a powerful tool for analyzing spatial-temporal datasets by decomposing the data into orthogonal modes of variability. This technique is widely used in fields like meteorology, oceanography, and climate science.

### Complex EOFs (CEOFs)
CEOFs extend the concept of EOFs to complex-valued data, capturing both the amplitude and phase of oscillatory patterns. This is particularly useful for analyzing waveforms and other oscillatory phenomena.

### Rotated EOFs (REOFs)
REOFs involve rotating the EOFs to achieve more localized and interpretable patterns. The Varimax rotation is commonly used to make the resulting modes more physically meaningful.

### Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA)
MCA is a technique used to identify coupled patterns between two different datasets by finding pairs of patterns that explain the maximum covariance. This method is essential for studying interactions between different physical processes.

## Usage

This repository is intended as a resource for understanding and implementing advanced EOF analysis techniques. Each markdown file contains explanations of the mathematical concepts, key definitions, and examples of how these techniques are used in practice.
